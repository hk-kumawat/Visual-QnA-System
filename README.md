## Models 🧠

### **VILT (Vision-and-Language Transformer)**
- A model used for Visual Question Answering.
- Uses a combination of image features and text input to provide answers.

### **BLIP (Bootstrapping Language-Image Pretraining)**
- A model for generating captions from images.
- The captions are used to generate possible questions for the user to ask.
