## Features🌟

- Upload an image and receive a generated caption.
- Choose from suggested questions or ask your own.
- Get answers to questions based on the image content.
- Built with **Streamlit** for an interactive and easy-to-use interface.

<br>

## Models🧠

### **VILT (Vision-and-Language Transformer)**
- A model used for Visual Question Answering.
- Uses a combination of image features and text input to provide answers.

### **BLIP (Bootstrapping Language-Image Pretraining)**
- A model for generating captions from images.
- The captions are used to generate possible questions for the user to ask.

<br>

## Installation🛠

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hk-kumawat/Visual-QnA.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
<br>

## Usage🚀

1. **Run the Streamlit App**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. **Upload Image**: Choose an image from your local drive.
3. **Select Question**: You can either pick a suggested question or write your own.
4. **Get Answer**: Click the "Predict Answer" button to receive an answer to your question about the image.

<br>

## Technologies Used💻

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `Streamlit` for the web interface
  - `PIL` for image handling
  - `Transformers` from Hugging Face for pre-trained models
- **Models**:
  - **VILT**: `dandelin/vilt-b32-finetuned-vqa`
  - **BLIP**: `Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base`

<br>

## Results🏆

The Visual QnA System offers an interactive experience where users can ask questions about images. It successfully generates captions and suggests questions based on image content, as well as providing accurate answers using the **VILT** model.

<br>

The **Visual QnA System** successfully answers questions based on image content. Here's an example of how the system works:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bfd1cfcd-6b5e-4ae3-804b-0429f92cffcb" alt="Example: Soccer image with question and answer" width="600"/>
</p>

In this case, the system was asked, **_"What sport is being played?"_** and the response was **_"Soccer,"_** showcasing its ability to understand the context of images.

<br>

## Conclusion📚

The **Visual QnA System** is a powerful application of **computer vision** and **natural language processing**. By integrating **image captioning** and **question answering** models, it provides an engaging and intuitive way for users to interact with images. This project demonstrates the potential of **AI-driven image understanding** and its wide range of applications in fields like **AI chatbots**, **image search engines**, and **education and e-learning**.


With the ability to analyze and answer questions about images, it can enhance **customer support**, optimize **image-based search results**, and improve **personalized recommendations** based on visual content. Additionally, it has immense potential in areas like **healthcare for diagnostic imaging**, **security and surveillance**, and even in **autonomous vehicles**, where understanding the visual environment is critical.
